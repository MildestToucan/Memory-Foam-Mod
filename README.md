Memory Foam
======
A simple mod that adds a potion effect whenever you sleep in a specific type of bed.  
Only a proof of concept for now, gives 15 seconds of regeneration when waking up from the Handcrafted Fancy Bed.  
In the future, this mod will be mod-agnostic and configurable, with the idea of allowing server owners and modpack creators to add 
different effects based on the bed the player sleeps in.  
Ports to other modloaders and MC versions in the future.
